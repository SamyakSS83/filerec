# FileRec - Project Status

This document outlines the current implementation status of the FileRec project components as of June 3, 2025.

## Overview

FileRec is designed as a comprehensive file recovery tool with two primary recovery methods:

1. **Signature-based Recovery** - Finding files based on known file headers and footers
2. **Metadata-based Recovery** - Recovering files by parsing filesystem structures

## Component Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Core Engine | ✅ Functional | Basic framework in place and working |
| Disk Scanner | ✅ Functional | Can read disk images properly |
| Recovery Engine | ✅ Functional | Can combine recovery methods |
| Progress Tracker | ✅ Functional | Shows progress during recovery |
| File System Detector | ✅ Functional | Can detect filesystem types |

### File Carvers

| Carver | Implementation | Testing | Notes |
|--------|---------------|---------|-------|
| JPEG Carver | ✅ Complete | ✅ Tested | Recovers JPEG files successfully |
| PDF Carver | ✅ Complete | ✅ Tested | Recovers PDF files successfully |
| PNG Carver | ✅ Complete | ❓ Partially Tested | Basic functionality works |
| ZIP Carver | ✅ Complete | ❓ Partially Tested | Basic functionality works |

### Filesystem Parsers

| Parser | Detection | Recovery | Testing | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|-------|
| EXT4 Parser | ✅ Complete | ⚠️ In Progress | ✅ Tests Created | Can detect EXT4 but metadata recovery not working |
| NTFS Parser | ✅ Complete | ⚠️ In Progress | ✅ Tests Created | Can detect NTFS but metadata recovery not working |
| FAT32 Parser | ✅ Complete | ⚠️ In Progress | ✅ Tests Created | Can detect FAT32 but metadata recovery not working |

### Testing Framework

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Unit Tests | ✅ Complete | Comprehensive tests for individual components |
| Integration Tests | ✅ Complete | Tests for component interactions |
| Blackbox Tests | ✅ Complete | Simple and full blackbox testing scripts available |

## Current Limitations

1. **Metadata-based Recovery** - All filesystem parsers can detect their respective filesystems but cannot yet recover deleted files based on metadata. This is a high priority area for future development.

2. **Filesystem Parser Edge Cases** - The filesystem parsers need to be enhanced to handle edge cases like fragmented files, corrupted filesystem structures, and partially overwritten files.

3. **Correlation between Signature and Metadata** - Currently there's limited correlation between signature and metadata findings to improve recovery accuracy.

## Recommendations for Use

1. **Use Signature-based Recovery** - For now, the most reliable recovery method is signature-based recovery. Use the `-s` flag when running the tool.

2. **Testing with Simple Images** - For best results during testing, use simple disk images created with the `blackbox_test_simple.sh` script rather than complex real-world partitions.

3. **Development Focus** - When contributing to the project, focus on improving the metadata-based recovery in the filesystem parsers, as this is the area most in need of enhancement.

## TODO List

1. **High Priority**
   - Fix EXT4 parser to recover deleted inodes
   - Improve NTFS parser to recover deleted MFT entries
   - Enhance FAT32 parser to recover deleted directory entries

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Add correlation between signature-based and metadata-based findings
   - Improve confidence scoring for recovered files
   - Add support for more file types (DOC, DOCX, XLS, etc.)

3. **Low Priority**
   - GUI interface for easier operation
   - Performance optimizations for very large disk images
   - Automatic report generation for recovered files
