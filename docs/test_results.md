# Current Test Results and Expectations

This document provides information about the current testing status of FileRec and what results to expect when running different types of tests.

## Signature-based Recovery Testing

### Status: ✅ WORKING

Signature-based recovery is currently the most reliable recovery method in FileRec. When using this method:

- Expected to find all JPEG, PDF, PNG, and ZIP files with valid headers/footers
- High confidence scores for recovered files indicate high reliability
- Works across all filesystems as it ignores filesystem metadata

### Test Commands:

```bash
# Run signature-only recovery on a test image
./build/FileRecoveryTool -v -s test_image.img test_output
```

## Metadata-based Recovery Testing

### Status: ⚠️ IN DEVELOPMENT

Metadata-based recovery is still under development and has several limitations:

- Filesystem detection works correctly for EXT4, NTFS, and FAT32
- Parsers can read basic filesystem metadata
- Recovery of deleted files via metadata is not yet functional

### Current Limitations:

1. **EXT4 Parser**: Can detect filesystem and read superblock data, but cannot yet recover deleted inodes
2. **NTFS Parser**: Can detect filesystem and locate MFT, but cannot yet recover deleted file entries
3. **FAT32 Parser**: Can detect filesystem and read FAT structures, but cannot yet recover deleted directory entries

### Test Commands:

```bash
# Run metadata-only recovery on a test image
./build/FileRecoveryTool -v -m test_image.img test_output
```

## Testing Methods

### Simple Blackbox Test

This is the recommended approach for testing FileRec. The script creates a controlled environment that clearly demonstrates what's working and what isn't:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/blackbox_test_simple.sh
```

**Expected Results:**
- Signature-based recovery: 4 files recovered
- Metadata-based recovery: 0 files recovered (due to current limitations)
- Full recovery: 4 files recovered (same as signature-based)

### Full Blackbox Test

This is a more complex test that attempts recovery on real disk partitions:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/blackbox_test.sh /dev/sdX1
```

**Expected Results:**
- May detect NTFS filesystem but will recover 0 files via metadata
- Will recover files via signature-based methods if they have standard headers

## Interpreting Test Results

When looking at test results, focus on:

1. **Filesystem Detection**: Does FileRec correctly identify the filesystem type?
2. **Signature-based Recovery**: Are files with known signatures being found?
3. **Validation**: Are recovered files valid and have the correct content?

## Development Focus Areas

Based on current test results, these areas need focus:

1. **EXT4 Parser**: Implement recovery of deleted inodes
2. **NTFS Parser**: Implement recovery of deleted MFT entries
3. **FAT32 Parser**: Implement recovery of deleted directory entries
4. **Integration**: Improve coordination between signature and metadata-based recovery

## Test Result Logs

Test logs should be carefully analyzed when filesystems are correctly identified but no files are recovered via metadata. This is the expected behavior currently, but the logs may contain valuable information for debugging the parsers.
