# FileRec - Recovery Methods Status

This document provides a quick overview of the current status of different recovery methods in FileRec.

## Recovery Methods Overview

FileRec implements two primary approaches to file recovery:

### 1. Signature-based Recovery

**Status: ✅ WORKING**

Signature-based recovery scans raw data for known file signatures (magic numbers) and attempts to identify file boundaries. This method:

- Works independently of filesystem structures
- Can recover files even when filesystem metadata is corrupted
- Successfully recovers JPEGs, PDFs, PNGs, and ZIP files
- Provides confidence scores based on structural validation

**Command to use:**
```bash
./build/FileRecoveryTool -v -s <device/image> <output_directory>
```

### 2. Metadata-based Recovery

**Status: ⚠️ IN DEVELOPMENT**

Metadata-based recovery attempts to parse filesystem structures to identify deleted files. Currently:

- Successfully detects filesystem types (EXT4, NTFS, FAT32)
- Can parse basic filesystem structures
- Cannot yet recover deleted files using metadata

**Command to use (for testing only):**
```bash
./build/FileRecoveryTool -v -m <device/image> <output_directory>
```

### 3. Combined Recovery (Default)

**Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING**

When no specific mode is specified, FileRec attempts both recovery methods. Currently:

- Will successfully find files using signature-based recovery
- May detect filesystem but won't recover additional files via metadata
- Same results as using signature-based recovery alone

**Command to use:**
```bash
./build/FileRecoveryTool -v <device/image> <output_directory>
```

## Filesystem Parsers Status

## File Carvers Status

| File Type | Header Detection | Footer Detection | Structure Validation | Confidence Scoring |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| JPEG      | ✅ Working       | ✅ Working       | ✅ Working          | ✅ Working        |
| PDF       | ✅ Working       | ✅ Working       | ✅ Working          | ✅ Working        |
| PNG       | ✅ Working       | ✅ Working       | ✅ Working          | ✅ Working        |
| ZIP       | ✅ Working       | ✅ Working       | ✅ Working          | ✅ Working        |

## Recommended Usage

For the best results with the current version:

1. Use signature-based recovery mode (`-s` flag)
2. Run with verbose output (`-v` flag) to monitor progress
3. For testing, use the `blackbox_test_simple.sh` script
4. Report any issues with file detection or recovery quality
